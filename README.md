Dessert submission for Fetch Internship by Samuel Smith
-
My goal was to create a user-friendly app with a somewhat full and polished look using as much data from the API as possible. Collaborated briefly with a professional iOS App designer for some of the design choices.

What I would like to improve/add with more time on the App: Unit Testing, Handling Errors, Networking Layer, Reusability of components

Thank you for your consideration! Feel free to email me with any questions.
